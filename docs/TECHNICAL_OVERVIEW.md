# MCPApp Technical Overview

## System Description

MCPApp is a sophisticated voice-enabled conversational AI application that bridges human users with Microsoft Learn documentation through advanced AI technologies. The application implements a complete voice-to-voice interaction pipeline, leveraging Azure OpenAI services and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for intelligent information retrieval.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Voice-First Design
The application prioritizes voice interaction as the primary user interface, creating a natural and accessible experience for users who prefer spoken communication over traditional text-based interfaces.

### 2. Real-Time Documentation Access
Through MCP integration, the system provides instant access to Microsoft Learn's comprehensive documentation, ensuring users receive current and accurate technical information.

### 3. Stateless Scalability
The application design supports horizontal scaling on Azure App Service through stateless component architecture and efficient session management.

## MCP Integration Specification

### Protocol Implementation
The application implements MCP (Model Context Protocol) to enable seamless integration between the GPT model and external knowledge sources. This protocol allows for:

- Real-time documentation queries
- Contextual information retrieval
- Dynamic content filtering
- Multi-source knowledge aggregation

    "description": "Queries the Microsoft Cloud Documentation information.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "query": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The query to send to the MCP API."
        }
      },
      "required": ["query"]
    }
  }
}
```
